Installation Steps:
--==============---

1. Install the CentOS 6.5 64Bit version.
2. sudo yum update -y
3. yum -y install openssh-server openssh-clients
4. service sshd start
5. chkconfig sshd on
6. netstat -tulpn | grep :22
7. service sshd restart
8. wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
9. wget http://rpms.famillecollet.com/enterprise/remi-release-6.rpm
10. sudo rpm -Uvh remi-release-6*.rpm epel-release-6*.rpm
11. sudo vim /etc/yum.repos.d/remi.repo

edit the lines:
---------------

[remi]
name=Les RPM de remi pour Enterprise Linux 6 - $basearch
#baseurl=http://rpms.famillecollet.com/enterprise/6/remi/$basearch/
mirrorlist=http://rpms.famillecollet.com/enterprise/6/remi/mirror

enabled=1 <<<< change from 0 to 1

gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-remi

failovermethod=priority <<<< new line added

--------------------------------------------------------------

12. After install you must have two network interfaces:

eth0: 172.168.122.72/24 (management interface) and should be static IP

vim /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

DEVICE="eth0"
BOOTPROTO="static"
IPV6INIT="yes"
IPV6_AUTOCONF="yes"
IPADDR="192.168.122.74"
NETMASK="255.255.255.0"
GATEWAY="172.168.122.1"
DNS="8.8.8.8"
ONBOOT="yes"
TYPE="Ethernet"

and eth1, that we will plug into br-ex later, packstack all in one will setup 172.24.4.224/28 on br-ex (public interface)

write a ifcfg-eth1 like this, it will bring up the interface, with no IP, it will also connect this interface to br-ex openvswitch bridge.

vim /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1

DEVICE=eth1
TYPE=Ethernet
ONBOOT=yes
DEVICETYPE=ovs
OVS_BRIDGE=br-ex
TYPE=OVSPort

--------------------------------------------------------------
13. vim /etc/selinux/config 
edit the line:
---------------
# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#       enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#       permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
#       disabled - SELinux is fully disabled.

SELINUX=disabled <<<<(change from enforcing/permissive to disabled)

# SELINUXTYPE= type of policy in use. Possible values are:
#       targeted - Only targeted network daemons are protected.
#       strict - Full SELinux protection.
SELINUXTYPE=targeted 

14. reboot (After rebooting the system, you got static IP on your eth0 interface. check ifconfig)
15. sudo yum update -y
16. sudo yum install -y https://rdo.fedorapeople.org/rdo-release.rpm
17. sudo yum install -y openstack-packstack
18. sudo yum install iproute
19. ip netns
20. cd /root/
21. packstack --gen-answer-file packstack_customanswerfile.txt
22. vim packstack_customanswerfile.txt 
(Modify your custom settings like IP,Mysql db, keystone and neutron passwords on the answer file)
23. packstack --answer-file=packstack_customanswerfile.txt 
24. ovs-vsctl add-port br-ex eth1 

25. Running an Instance through Dashboard:
========================
Step 1: Visit the Dashboard

Log in to the Openstack dashboard at http://CONTROL_NODE[Your IP]/dashboard - the username is "demo". The password can be found in the file keystonerc_demo in the /root/ directory of the control node.

Note: make sure you use the "demo" username here. 

Step 2: Launch two VM instances

from here http://192.168.122.74/dashboard/project/instances/ you will be able to create a new instance: create a cirros instance using "Launch Instance" button

First Instance:
---------------

source: Image
image: cirros
instance name: Instance1
flavor: m1.tiny
count: 1

Access & security: 
    you can add a keypair, for example your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub or any other..
    or you can set an admin pass

Networking:
   *drag and drop the private networking into  the selected network,


Click on "Launch"

Second Instance:
----------------

source: Image
image: cirros
instance name: Instance2
flavor: m1.tiny
count: 1

Access & security: 
    you can add a keypair, for example your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub or any other..
    or you can set an admin pass

Networking:
   *drag and drop the private networking into  the selected network,


Click on "Launch"

Step 2: Enjoy watching your new network topology

http://192.168.122.74/dashboard/project/network_topology/

Step 3: Log into your first instance

Go into the first instance, open the console, and login with "cirros" / "cubswin:)"

ping 10.0.0.4

it should work..., your instance is connected to the other on your private_subnet

STEP 4: Add a floating IP and setup external conectivity

Go to your instances again:

http://192.168.122.74/dashboard/project/instances/

Add a floating IP to the second instance:

Just click on the right "More v" -> Associate Floating IP

It will say "No IP Address available", click on the "+" to reserve some for your project,
then select it: ( 172.24.4.227 on my system)  on the port, select the "cirros2", which is 
your second instance on 10.0.0.4

Click "Associate"

Step 5: Setup your management machine to access the VMs

My management machine, has connection to the external addresses on the second interface, that in fact, for my, it goes into the same physical L2 network (as they do on my test openstack machine).

So I setup a second ip on my management machine (your desktop PC) , assuming linux, use the last IP on the range for 172.24.4.224/28 :

sudo ifconfig eth0:1 172.24.4.238 netmask 255.255.255.240  

Step 6: Setup security groups to let you ping & SSH

before trying to ping it, or connecting into it, go to your security groups:

http://192.168.122.74/dashboard/project/access_and_security/ and edit the default rules:

Add rules to open ICMP and SSH:

    Add rule:

      rule: Custom ICMP Rule
      direction: ingress
      type: 8  (ICMP echo request)
      code: -1 (= ignore)
      remote: CIDR
      CIDR: keep 0.0.0.0/0 to accept from any source, or 172.24.4.238/32 to accept pings only from your PC

    Add rule

    rule: Custom TCP Rule direction: ingress open port: port (only one) port: 22 (ssh) remote: CIDR CIDR: same as the previous rule

Step 7: Test conectivity from your PC

ping 174.24.4.227 

it can need a few seconds until the new iptables rules are installed by neutron and the ping starts working.
(Make sure your Instance is running)

try to ssh from your pc:

slogin cirros@172.24.4.227   

password: "cubswin:)" or the one you set, or nothing (if you added a PK)


Thats it. you are done.. :)
