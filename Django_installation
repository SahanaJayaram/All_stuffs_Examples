Task .2 

Execute the Django command through Jenkins

1. pip install django

### It works fine !!##

2. sudo pip install django

( If I try this command, will get an error like below : )

Error : sudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified
jenkins is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.

***********

Granting the user to use that command without prompting for password should resolve the problem. First open a shell console and type:

$ sudo visudo

(this is the command to access the /etc/sudoers file)
Then edit that file to add to the very end:

jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

### It works fine with sudo ##

Task .3 
***************
1. create django project

a) To check the version of Django 

$ python -c "import django; print(django.get_version())"

b) From the command line, cd into a directory where you’d like to store your code, then run the following command:

$ django-admin.py startproject project-name

eg :
 
$ django-admin.py startproject onecloud

c) we need to create the tables in the database before we can use them. To do that, run the following command:

$ python manage.py migrate

#############
If we do not use the above command, it throws an message like below :
#############
You have unapplied migrations; your app may not work properly until they are applied. 
Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them. 

d ) To verify your Django project works :

$ python manage.py runserver

The following output on the command line:

  Performing system checks... 

  System check identified no issues (0 silenced). 
  October 07, 2014 - 11:34:38 
  Django version 1.7, using settings 'onecloud.settings'  
  Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ 
  Quit the server with CONTROL-C. 


Now that the server’s running, visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ with your Web browser. You’ll see a “Welcome to Django” page, in pleasant, light-blue pastel. It worked!

e) To change port :


If you want to change the server’s IP, pass it along with the port :

$ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

Now that the server’s running, visit http://0.0.0.0:8000/ with your Web browser.
